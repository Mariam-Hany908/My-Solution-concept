# My-Solution-concept 
This repository contains solutions to 3 problems and algorithms that I have worked on as part of my studies. Below is a summary of the approach I have taken and links to video explanations for each solution.

## Approach

Each solution is implemented with clarity and step-by-step logic, making sure that every problem is solved efficiently. 
I have used common data structures and algorithms such as arrays, linked lists, and dynamic programming. The code is written in [python.].

problem 1: take from the user list of the number of steps taken each day in a month
and make oprations : maximum steps , minimum steps , sort list , average steps 
I used : { list , min(), max(), sorted(), sum(), len() }

problem 2: we have record of books borrowed from a library for a month and calculate operations:
sort dictionary, find maximum and minimum book that was borrowed then find the unique titles of books(using list , dictionary, set)

problem 3: game to guss the correct word if I display shuffle word I used library random , mathod to shuffle the word , and used method .join to convert charachter to string
