# My-Solution-concept 
This repository contains solutions to various problems and algorithms that I have worked on as part of my studies. Below is a summary of the approach I have taken and links to video explanations for each solution.

## Approach

Each solution is implemented with clarity and step-by-step logic, making sure that every problem is solved efficiently. 
I have used common data structures and algorithms such as arrays, linked lists, and dynamic programming. The code is written in [python.].

problem 1: take from the user list of the number of steps taken each day in a month
and make oprations : maximum steps , minimum steps , sort list , average steps

problem 2:
